# README Generator

A command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. 

------

## Tech/Framework Used

Project is created with:

* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Axios library


## Usage

Describe the application's functionality:

The application will be invoked with the following command:
```
node index
```

Running `node index` will execute a series of questions that when completed, will be inserted into the README file. Questions include Github username, repository name, installation instructions, tech/frameworks used, usage description and more, and are contained in the `questionsGit` object.

The `generateMarkdown.js` file in the `utils` folder contains the string which integrates the user responses and generates the README file.
